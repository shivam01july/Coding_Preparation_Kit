# All Topics in Graph

### Breadth First Search (BFS)

### Depth First Search (DFS)  

### Detect Cycle In Graph
> *Used to check whether the graph has a Cycle, Negative Cycle or No Cycle in a Directed or UnDirected Graph.*

### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
> *MST uses Greedy Approach.*  
> *MST should be Connected Graph.*  
> *MST works in UnDirected Graph.*  
> *MST should not have any Cycle.*  
- **Prim's Algorithm**

### Shortest Paths
> 
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** 
    > *Shorter path from a given node to all vertices.*   
    > *Graph edge weight should be non negative.*   
    > *Uses Greedy Approach.*
- **Flyodd Warshall Algorithm**
	> *Shorter path from every vertex to every other vertex.*   
	> *Uses Dynamic Programming.*   
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
	> *Shortest paths from source to all vertices.*   
	> *Graph may contain negative weight edges.*   
	> *Uses Dynamic Programming.*
