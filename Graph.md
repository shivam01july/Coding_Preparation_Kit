Longest Path in a Directed Acyclic Graph
-- for directed acyclic graph
-- he famous algorithm uses DFS but you should also know Kahn's algorithm that uses BFS as it has much applications


Dijkstra - Shorter path from a given node to all vertices
-- single source shortest path when all edges are non negative
-- Greedy approach
Flyodd Warshall - Shorter path from every vertex to every other vertex
-- Dynamic programming
-- Floyd-Warshall's algorithm for solving the All Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) problem and it's variants.
Bellman Ford Algorithm 
-- Greedy approach
-- Bellman-Ford's algorithm for solving the SSSP problem with negative sycles.
