# All Topics in Graph

### Breadth First Search (BFS)

### Depth First Search (DFS)  

### Detect Cycle In Graph
> *Used to check whether the graph has a Cycle, Negative Cycle or No Cycle in a Directed or UnDirected Graph.*
- Detect Cycle in Directed Graph
- Detect Cycle in UnDirected Graph
- Detect Negative Cycle in a Graph
  - Negative Cycle Detection using **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
  - Negative Cycle Detection using **Floyd Warshall Algorithm**
- Disjoint-Set Or Union-Find *(DSU)*
	- **Union-Find Algorithm**
	- Cycle Detection in UnDirected Graph using DSU
	- Cycle Detection in Directed Graph using DSU

### Topological Sorting
> *Used for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).*
- Topological Sorting
- **Kahnâ€™s Algorithm**
- Longest Path between any pair of vertices
- Longest Path in a DAG

### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
> *MST uses Greedy Algorithm*
> A spanning tree means all vertices must be connected.
> Spanning tree must not have any cycle in it.
> connected and undirected graph
- **Prim's Algorithm**
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**


		Dijkstra - Shorter path from a given node to all vertices

-- single source shortest path when all edges are non negative
-- Greedy approach
Flyodd Warshall - Shorter path from every vertex to every other vertex
-- Dynamic programming
-- Floyd-Warshall's algorithm for solving the All Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) problem and it's variants.
Bellman Ford Algorithm 
-- Greedy approach
-- Bellman-Ford's algorithm for solving the SSSP problem with negative sycles.
