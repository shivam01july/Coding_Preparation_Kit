### Breadth First Search (BFS)

### Depth First Search (DFS)  

### Detect Cycle In Graph
> *Given a directed and undirected graph, check whether the graph has Cycle, Negative Cycle or No Cycle.*

4. Topological Sorting
5. Kahnâ€™s Algorithm for Topological Sorting
6. Longest path between any pair of vertices
Longest Path in a Directed Acyclic Graph
-- 
-- he famous algorithm uses DFS but you should also know Kahn's algorithm that uses BFS as it has much applications


Dijkstra - Shorter path from a given node to all vertices
-- single source shortest path when all edges are non negative
-- Greedy approach
Flyodd Warshall - Shorter path from every vertex to every other vertex
-- Dynamic programming
-- Floyd-Warshall's algorithm for solving the All Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) problem and it's variants.
Bellman Ford Algorithm 
-- Greedy approach
-- Bellman-Ford's algorithm for solving the SSSP problem with negative sycles.
